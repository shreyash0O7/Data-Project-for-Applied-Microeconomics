    "# Project Structure for Analyzing Movie Genre Performance Before and After COVID-19:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess the financial performance of various movie genres before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize the IMDb dataset to gather information on movies released in the years before and after the pandemic began (e.g., 2018-2019 for pre-COVID and 2020-2021 for post-COVID).\n",
    "Focus on key data points like genre, box office earnings, budget, and release dates.\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparative Revenue Analysis: Compare the total and average box office revenues of different genres in both periods.\n",
    "Genre Popularity Shifts: Identify any shifts in genre popularity. For example, did certain genres like horror or comedy become more popular post-COVID?\n",
    "Budget vs. Revenue: Examine if there's a change in the budget-to-revenue ratio across genres before and after COVID-19.\n",
    "Release Strategy Changes: Assess how release strategies (theatrical, streaming, hybrid) varied across genres and periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Theories and Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply microeconomic theories to explain changes in consumer preferences and market dynamics.\n",
    "Consider demand and supply shifts due to external factors like lockdowns, economic uncertainty, and changes in consumer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results and Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Present your findings in a clear, structured format.\n",
    "Interpret the results in the context of economic theories and the unique circumstances of the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize key insights regarding the impact of COVID-19 on movie genre performance.\n",
    "Discuss potential long-term implications for the film industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Further Research:\n",
    "\n",
    "Acknowledge any limitations in your data or analysis.\n",
    "Suggest areas for further research, such as a more detailed analysis of consumer preferences or the impact on independent films.\n",
    "This project can offer a comprehensive view of how extraordinary events like a pandemic can influence entertainment industry trends, providing a practical application of economic concepts to real-world scenarios. Remember to keep your analysis aligned with the principles of microeconomics"
